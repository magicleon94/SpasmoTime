# SpasmoTime
Simple Android Project to learn Alarm Intents, Services and Notifications.
The app allows the user to choose "special times" to be notified for, for example symmetric times such as "10:01" or "12:21" and so on.
There are others "criteria", and the notification allows the user to share the time with a pre-build message.
There's no survival to reboot, so when the phone is reboot the alarms are lost (the user must set them again by disabling and re-enabling the option)
Survival it's a to-do, but since the project has to be considered dropped (too annoying) I doubt it will ever implemented.
